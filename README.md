Mindful Companion is a state-of-the-art mental health chatbot designed to bridge the gap between digital interaction and human empathy. By combining **Real-time Facial Emotion Recognition** with **Multi-Model Hybrid Intelligence**, it provides a safe, responsive, and emotionally aware space for users to navigate their mental well-being.

## 🚀 Key Highlights & Technical Innovation

### 1. 🎭 Emotional Intelligence via Computer Vision
Unlike traditional chatbots that only read text, Mindful Companion **sees** how you feel.
- **DeepFace Integration:** Analyzes user facial expressions (Happy, Sad, Anxious, Neutral) via webcam.
- **Contextual Injection:** Facial emotions are fed directly into the LLM's prompt context, allowing the AI to adjust its tone dynamically (e.g., being more gentle if sadness is detected).

### 2. 🧠 Hybrid "Fail-Safe" AI Architecture
We prioritize reliability for mental health support. The system uses a multi-tier intelligence strategy:
- **Primary:** Cloud LLMs (Google Gemini 1.5 Flash / GPT-4o) via LangChain.
- **Secondary:** Adaptive fallback to local Scikit-Learn ML classifiers if APIs are offline.
- **Tertiary:** On-device Heuristic Engine powered by a curated mental health dataset (`MentalHealthChatbotDataset.json`).

### 3. 🛡️ Clinical Safety & Ethics
- **Crisis Detection:** Hard-coded safety guardrails detect keywords related to self-harm or aggression and immediately redirect to professional help resources.
- **Scope Guarding:** AI specifically refuses coding or technical tasks, maintaining its role as a dedicated wellness companion.

### 4. 📊 Holistic Mental Health Toolkit
Beyond chat, the platform provides a comprehensive wellness suite:
- **Mood Tracker:** Interactive visualizations of emotional trends.
- **Digital Journaling:** A private space for reflection and gratitude.
- **Resource Hub:** Curated library of mental health articles and emergency contacts.

### 5. ⚡ Seamless Interaction UX
- **Real-time Streaming:** Uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to stream AI responses word-by-word, creating a natural, fluid conversation without loading lag.
- **Responsive Design:** A premium interface built with **Tailwind CSS**, **Shadcn UI**, and animatons by **Framer Motion**.
